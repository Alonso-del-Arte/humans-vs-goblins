# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest contributors

Although this project started off as a class assignments, I am planning to open 
it up to Hacktoberfest 2022 contributors.

* Build tool is IntelliJ IDEA's default. Don't bother me about the build tool.
* Java 8, JUnit 5 (Jupiter). At my option I may change to Java 11. You may use 
 later versions of Java on your end provided your pull requests don't call for 
 features from later versions. 
* Column width is 80.
* Indentation interval is four spaces.
* No comments except Javadoc or TODO.
* Pull requests should be to address either issues or TODO comments.
